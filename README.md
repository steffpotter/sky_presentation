<h3>Mock database Implementation</h3>
Given that we don't know for sure whether we will be given time/ allowance to provision a hosted db I've
added the ability to toggle between use of a mock python based db or a real MySQL db using Steff's script.

If you want to use the mock db, in routes.py, set the "useMock" environment variable to 'True'.
Set it to 'False' if you want to use the real MySQL database.
